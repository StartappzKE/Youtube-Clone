# Youtube-Clone-
Hello everyone, I have a youtube clone that I would like to share/help work on. Currently the script for the youtube clone is outdated. I tried working on this project by my self, however I havent had the time to finish it. So I've decided to post the script here so we all can work on it, perhaps even make this project go "online".

Breif history - been working on a CMS project that I've learned from Udemy (teacher name is Edwin Diaz) got a cert on making a PHP website, however some parts of his lecture I wasnt able to complete due to the project have to be online/pay for hosting. Afterwords I got this idea I should make a social media website to promote people's content. This website will give people the option to do anything they want (as long it follow the rules) . They dont have to worry about being ban to their "offensive posts" . On this site you are expected to see things that might not fit with your beliefs, and vice versa.

So yea, I'll be working on this project and if anyone want to join in I welcome you!
