However there is a deeper meaning to &ldquo;work-out&rdquo; or in many cases to &ldquo;exercise&rdquo; . Just by staying active throughout your life, you are keeping your muscles strong. This includes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">joints, tendons, etc to allow you to move more with less of a chance to get an injury. This is only just by having strong muscles and ligaments, how about your other parts? For starters, you are able to have better coordination and balance than a person that does not exercise. &ldquo;The more you exercise, the more calories you burn, that means, the more muscle you develop, the higher your metabolic rate becomes, so you burn more calories even when you&rsquo;re not exercising&rdquo; (This is a plus, if your schedule is too busy to exercise for long term, however you need to do &ldquo;warm ups&rdquo; to keep your body in shape). &nbsp;&ldquo;Another benefit of exercise is increase blood flow/oxygen levels to the brain.&rdquo; This then encourages the release of hormones that are responsible for the production of cells in the hippocampus, &ldquo;the part of the brain that controls memory and learning.&rdquo; The side effect of exercising, is a boost of concentration levels and cognitive ability, this helps reduce the risk of cognitive degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s. Being fit may mean that the &ldquo;risks of colon cancer, breast cancer and possibly also lung and endometrial cancers are reduced. Studies by the Seattle Cancer Research Centre have suggested that 35% of all cancer deaths are linked to being overweight and sedentary.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may ask what type of exercise I can do? For beginners you can do a &ldquo;moderate intensity exercise or vigorous intensity exercise.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Moderate intensity exercise</strong> <strong>definition</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> : &ldquo;</span><strong>Absolute moderate intensity has been defined by public health experts as any activity that expends 3.5 to 7 calories per minute. A classic example of moderate physical activity is walking at a 15-20 minute mile pace. Other examples of moderate intensity activities are: Brisk walking.&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Vigorous intensity exercise definition : &ldquo;</strong><strong>Light intensity activities require the least amount of effort, compared to moderate and vigorous activities. The definition for light intensity activity is an activity that is classified as &lt; 3 METS. One MET, or metabolic equivalent, is the amount of oxygen consumed while sitting at rest.&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>(</strong><strong><em>http://igrow.org/healthy-families/health-and-wellness/light-moderate-and-vigorous-activity/</em></strong><strong>)</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Examples of moderate intensity exercise include:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brisk walking (100 steps/minute)</span></li>\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dancing</span></li>\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swimming or aqua aerobics</span></li>\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gentle cycling (5-9mph)</span></li>\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Badminton or doubles tennis</span></li>\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volleyball&rdquo;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Examples of vigorous intensity exercise include:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running</span></li>\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power walking at 5mph or more, or walking uphill briskly</span></li>\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cycling faster than 10mph</span></li>\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aerobics</span></li>\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martial arts</span></li>\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competitive sports (football, basketball, rugby etc.)</span></li>\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skipping/jump rope</span></li>\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rowing&rdquo;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work Cited</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Why Is Exercise Important?" </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health Discovery</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

As a result the wildlife takes the most damage especially the birds that are living in the African Timber trees.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The bird that is taking heavy damage is Yellow-whiskered greenbul, its population has declined by 73 percent, and the icterine greenbul declined by 90% percent. Results further indicate that Ghana&rsquo;s forestry management system has seriously worsened due to widespread increases in logging , which has decreased or eliminated post-logging forest recovery.&rdquo; </span></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The logging is taking place at a tropical forest in africa that is located at the northern part of the Guinea Forest. This logging occurred at early 1995 which caused minimal damage to the forest until late 2010 in which the damage was relevant throughout the area. The reason for this consumers want more land available for housing and to urbanize the area. Another reason is to harvest the timber to create commercial items such as paper, furniture and homes. Lastly it is used to make either farms for agriculture or the land will be used for a new mining operation. Before the logging ever occur the resources timber was bountiful with a diverse wildlife living at the area, however as of today many of those species are either dead or migrated to a new area to live at. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article relates to me in a number of ways. The logging industry in Ghana most likely contributed to the toilet paper that I am using, or perhaps the wood became my paper that I used to make a rough draft for an assignment. However this comes at a cost of losing timber from the wildlife. It is best to make the timber industry at Guinea replant five saplings of Trees for every 3 trees they cut down.

One such purpose is for the degradation of toxic wastes using metabolic pathways to do so. By engineering the bacterial plasmid, which is a circular strand of DNA and inserting extra genes, the bacteria may be able to perform tasks such as cleaning up an oil spill or breaking down toxic wastes. Once a bacteria has been successfully modified, after it reproduces by cell division, each cell thereafter will copy the bacterial DNA and the gene that was inserted into the plasmid also. Therefore, a virtual endless supply of these bacteria will result that can perform the desired task.</span></li>\r\n</ol>', 'env sci, homework, free answers', '', 'published', 0),

Since people has not pay any attention during that time period they all will soon pay the price with their lives. This story is one In many incidents that plague people in the 1900&rsquo;s, fire safety. In the 1909, Americans were spending over twenty-three billion dollars on already made clothes alone, in which was high in demand during that time period. Since electricity was being used in many building complex it was commonly using AC power or DC power as a power source. The Triangle Factory was a clothes factory that generally goes with their current trend.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow as we all expected since there were no regulations on smoking inside a building anyone can smoke, but for this case however this has flammable material in which is prevalent throughout this building. The poor soul thought that they can put out the cigarette and that&rsquo;s all, they were wrong. They either didn&rsquo;t put it out right or just threw it in the trash bin, either way they&rsquo;ve caused the massive fire that killed two-hundred plus people in the building. After the fire consumes its host (the cloth) it began to spread to other flammable materials in which then either suffocated or burned the victims with them. On top of that some unlucky workers tried to jump off the building out of desperation.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many reasons of why two-hundred plus people were killed in this tragedy. First of all the Doors&rsquo; placement position were wrong they had to be place outward instead of inward, second they didn&rsquo;t had sufficient &nbsp;enough exits to allow people to escape, nor did they have automatic sprinklers to put down the fire either. On top of that most of their exits were locked, in which it was impractical for them to escape unharmed (mentally or physically). &nbsp;Even though there were some negative outcomes that came from this event, there were some positive events that occurred too. There were new laws put in place and regulations to protect peoples&rsquo; lives, and most of their property. This helped fueled new laws in which created new jobs. In which allowed new inventions to be made such as the automatic sprinkler and a fire extinguisher. It is better to use a fire extinguisher than a wet cloth. Since this is the 21 first century, and it is better to use an fire extinguisher than a wet cloth too. Since this is the 21 first century we have the technology of the means to save lives and prevent extensive property damage. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now on a modern day aspect of things I think we should reform the way we see math &amp; science, the reason is very simple. Not too many youngsters are interested in these subjects. Instead they are interested in other activity that does not support their economy, community, health nor their intelligence. We should at promote science and math because were falling behind other countries. </span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/08/25/students.science.math/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/08/25/students.science.math/</span></a></p>', 'fire safety, random, old file', '', 'published', 0),

A key step along the path to ignition is to have "fuel gains" greater than unity, where the energy generated through fusion reactions exceeds the amount of energy deposited into the fusion fuel.&rdquo; (Eduard Dewald)</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact since the fusion cell mimics like the sun energy source of nuclear fusion then we would have a boundless supply of energy from Fusion. That&rsquo;s why scientists&rsquo; had decided to work on the Project Nuclear Fusion a natural element found in nature. Also another factor is because to find a clean and cost efficient energy source for the masses, as we all know around 2050-2070 the world&rsquo;s oil supply will dwindle because of oil pits being drained out. Therefore at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DOE/Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Scientists&rsquo; are working furiously at making the fuel cell to perfection so it can be both cost efficient and Safe for people to drive with them in their vehicles</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an educational relationship because this field of science is about Nuclear Physics. This article relates to the field because the Physicists&rsquo; are working with Nuclear energy in finding ways to make it safe to be around humans without causing serious harm to life forms. Scientists are studying the efficiently of the fusion reactors and had proven that the production of energy is near 100% (due to smashing atoms together that requires an additional energy source. &nbsp;For the definition there was no new words that I couldn&rsquo;t, due to me reading about quantum mechanics&rsquo; books. &nbsp;Nuclear fusion, the source of all the energy is radiated by the Sun, it does two things it converts hydrogen into helium and it converts mass to energy.&rdquo; &nbsp;This is another reason of why this is an educational relationship because Nuclear fusion and the stars of the universe works&rsquo; in the same concept.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How this article does relates to me? It&rsquo;s quite simple to answer relates to me because I love science, and how the atoms works in its own unique way of doing things is interesting to learn. Another reason is because we need to find a new energy source that can end pollution and can make vehicles much more efficient in transportation. &nbsp;Once we officially finish the project for fusion there will be a great change on how we drive our cars, drive planes, boats, rocket ships, and much more. Human expansion of all over the world and in the cosmos rely on creative minds that will ultimately change human history for the greater good. This is the main reason of why I am interested in science, and this is why I would like to continue to learn about Quantum mechanics (Energy studies) &nbsp;because I want to help the cause to find a new way to make a clean energy source</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citation-</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Experiments Show Initial Gain in Fusion Fuel."

As we were looking for Jumpy all around the house my mom asked us what are we doing and we said we are looking for Jumpy. She said, &ldquo;You better look for jumpy or else your dad would be disappointed.&rdquo; &nbsp;So my mom helped us out for looking a runaway tortoise. &nbsp;As we look for Jumpy we had no luck we checked all over the house we checked under the dark abysses of our beds checked the cheerful underground couch and we even checked under desks,tables,chairs, even in the toy boat toy for the tortoise to swim around/clean themselves. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We still have no luck and after 2 hours later all of my brothers quit looking for Jumpy and call it a day. But I did not give up so I continued to look and when I went downstairs my mom was vacuuming and I ask her did you find jumpy and she said no shes probably upstairs. And I said &ldquo;all right I will check upstairs&rdquo; with doubts in my mind. Now 1 hour passed and no luck in finding jumpy. Jumpy has a long history of being lost in the house that is because she is smart she can fool my little brothers Jonah and Jacob in thinking she is sleeping or she is too shy to come out of her smooth shell but actually she is devious and very smart and same for my other tortoise each and every one of them have their own special abilities of their own too. Now its 3:53 P.M and I said, &ldquo;where are you JUMPY!?!&rdquo; Even though my thoughts are filled up with doubts by the time now my dad wakes up and came downstairs.

Also another factor is because it is unstable to sustain itself for mere seconds before breaking apart into smaller elements and atoms. &nbsp;The Japanese&rsquo;s scientists at RIKEN Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science in Japan announced at September &nbsp;26, 2012, explaining why this element was unstable and &nbsp;was formed quickly but then it self destruct itself but the good news is that the team was able to record to data as proof of the accomplishment. &ldquo; For over nine years, we have been searching for data conclusively identifying element 113, and now that at last we have it, it feels like a great weight has been lifted from our shoulders.&rdquo; Explained Kosuke Morita (he is the leader of the research group.)</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now since the Japanese scientists has official confirmed there achievement of making element 113 , then Japan will have &ldquo;the rights to name the new element 113 on the periodic table&rdquo; which in turn makes it the first Asian country to ever officially make a &nbsp;name in the periodic table. &nbsp;At the same time Germany, Russia, and the United States scientists are now testing this new element to see its uses in the future and to make sure that the element is really true, even though they have evidence to prove its existence. The reason why other scientists are testing this experiments for the fun of it and for the joy of discovery with the knowledge of how atoms work. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educational Relationship: &nbsp;This field of science is about Quantum mechanics, and this article relates to the field because the Japanese scientists are studying the element 113 which is about Quantum mechanics plus you have to have a degree in Quantum mechanics to even study this anyway. There are a few vocabulary that I don&rsquo;t know until know from this article like the following: element 113: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ununtrium: a radioactive transuranic element</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and bismuth: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the chemical element of atomic number 83, a brittle reddish-gray metal.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;That&rsquo;s all the new vocabulary I&rsquo;ve have learned from this article, and how does this article relates to me, it&rsquo;s quite astonishingly relates to me because I love science, and how the atoms works its quite fascinating. Because we all are made of the same compounds and we are similar in the atomically frequency. &nbsp;We are the Universe and the Universe are us, so that means everything what you see now your house, cars, people, animals, skyscrapers, rocket ships, bacteria, chemicals, and the cosmos are all you. You are also them in the atomic level, therefore everything is related to each other in some way or form, and that&rsquo;s why I love to learn science because of that. This is the main reason why I am interested in science, and this is why I would like to continue about science because of that one &ldquo;idea&rdquo; of how everything is created.</span></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>', 'science, element 113, element, Japan, data, proof, periodic table', '', 'published', 0),

She made many small household appliances in her spare time such as the &ldquo;mechanical eggbeater&rdquo; </span><a href="http://www.pbs.org/tesla/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(pbs.org/tesla/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Teslas father Milutin was an Orthodox priest and when Tesla was very young he submerged himself in his fathers diverse library. When he was a teenager he attended &ldquo;gymnasium in Carlstadt, Croatia&rdquo; (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">/etradict2.htm). Tesla exceeded his colleagues studies in integral calculus in which led his teachers to believe that he was cheating. During this time intuitive Nikola saw a steel engraving of Niagara Falls.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ldquo;In Nikola Teslas minds eye appeared a huge water wheel being turned by a powerful waterfall&rdquo; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(PBS.org/tesla).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Young Nikola Tesla once told his uncle that he would one day go to America and capture Mother Nature water energy. &ldquo;Thirty years later he did exactly that. Despite his early creativity, Tesla did not begin to think of himself as an inventor until he was a young adult.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pbs.org/tesla/ll/index</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) &nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikola Tesla was a very avid learner in mathematics and science, Tesla had his dream job on becoming an &ldquo;engineer but was continuously oppressed by his fathers insistence that he enter the priesthood.&rdquo; (PBS.org/tesla) At seventeen, Tesla contracted Cholera and demanded a compromise with his father. His father promised that if he survived, he would be allowed to attend the renowned Austrian Polytechnic School at Graz to study engineering. Tesla survived and soon his dream became a reality. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikola Tesla healed very quickly to everyone astonishment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla then went to a Polytechnic school in which he studied electrical and mechanical engineering. On one evening, his physics Gramme dynamo&rdquo; in which he used DC (direct current) as a power source. He showed now DC could be used as a generator and a motor teacher demonstrated to Teslas class a &ldquo;A few moments later Tesla suggested that it might be possible &ldquo;to do away with a set of inefficient sparking connections known as commutators.&rdquo; (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Nikola Tesla."&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">History.com).</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This made his professor ridicule Tesla in front of the entire class for thinking alternating electrical currents were even possible. So Tesla left the university and tried to find someone who has a similar belief in his vision about alternating current. &nbsp;So he decided go to America and try to get employed by his all-time hero, Thomas Edison.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikola Teslas adventure did not start well. On his way to the ship that was traveling to New York, he almost missed his train, lost some of his cash, his luggage, passport and his ticket for the ride. &ldquo;However he did manage to board on the ship but was later arrested because he was stuck in a middle of a fight on board the ship (Bio.com).&rdquo;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Before Tesla could do all of that he had to apply for the job in joining Edison Company. So he sent him mail saying &ldquo;My Dear Edison, I know two great men and you are one of them. The other is this young man!&rdquo; (Nikola Tesla </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">History.com</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">). After these incidences occurred he still manages to find Thomas Edison and show his plans called &ldquo;Alternating Current&rdquo; (AC). &nbsp;Thomas Edison saw that Tesla has potential as an inventor and engineer so he hired him. When Tesla told Edison that he could improve his Direct Current generators, Edison proposed that if he completes this project he will gain fifty thousand dollars. A Few months later Tesla completed this project and ask for his payment. Edison later remark &ldquo;When you become a full-fledged American, you will appreciate an American joke.&rdquo;(</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas Edison</span></em> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">History.com</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) On the bright side of things he did increase Tesla wages to eighteen dollars per week on top the original of ten dollars.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla left the company disappointed and tried to make his own company but was later scammed by investors that took away his assets and the company itself that Tesla has built with them. &nbsp;Desperate for work, Tesla had to dig ditches for two dollars each day. Not planning to give up too easy to scammers, haters, bad influences, and to the old way of thinking of energy, Tesla continued working and asking &ldquo;trust-worthy&rdquo; investors to give him the right resources (including cash payments) to make alternating current possible, and with enough investment to make a mini laboratory lab to conduct his experiments. Eventually he inspired George Westinghouse to give Tesla even more payments for his research in hopes of building an alternating current system across North America and the world. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikola Tesla was able to overcome these obstacles by being an introvert. &ldquo;Be alone, that is the secret of invention; be alone, that is when ideas are born&rdquo; (Nikola Tesla). Nikola Tesla had to look for people who believed in his new way of generating electricity (AC) in which he found Westinghouse, Mark Twain, Joseph Jefferson, Robert Underwood Johnson, and many others believed that AC was possible and proved so. He kept working, and he kept believing in himself and his ideas. A lot of good things came of out of his persistence and determination in the face of adversity like wireless commutations, alternating current, basic radar and laser technology, x-ray, neon lights robotics, modern electric motor, cellular technology, remote control, and Star Wars technology.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As AC (alternating currents) started to &ldquo;steam ahead&rdquo; and Tesla finally received some of the recognition that he deserved. Edison, however, began to feel threatened by Teslas AC (alternating current) technology. Edison and his major investor, J.P. Morgan, began a campaign of malicious propaganda against Tesla and his technology. In an effort to show the dangers of alternating current (AC) and to discredit Nik ola Tesla, Thomas Edison held public demonstrations in which he electrocuted animals&mdash; such as dogs, cats, horses, and even a circus elephant&mdash;in front of an audience. He even paid school boys around the age 8-13 to steal cats and dogs so he can electrocute more animals (yes, he did payed the young boys to steal household pets). He even used Teslas AC technology for the to make nthe electric chair it even more &ldquo;horrendous&rdquo; to use.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with the animal and human execution</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kemmler"><span style="font-weight: 400;">William Kemmler</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a convicted murder) Tesla was still able to thrive above Edison. &ldquo;Westinghouse and Tesla lit the 1891 Worlds Columbian Exposition in </span><a href="http://www.history.com/topics/chicago"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and partnered with General Electric to install AC generators at </span><a href="http://www.history.com/topics/niagara-falls"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niagara Falls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, creating the first modern power station</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&rdquo; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">history.com /Nikola-tesla</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tesla completed</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">his lifelong dream by taming natures water and using it as an energy source for clean energy. As the propaganda failed to hit Tesla directly Edison and Morgan decided to attack Tesla main source of income&hellip; Westinghouse. &nbsp;J.P Morgan made an &ldquo;offer&rdquo; to Westinghouse explaining many &ldquo;rewards&rdquo; if he would stop the flow of income to Tesla. Westinghouse furiously refuse the offer because he was already gaining a profit from the AC technology. Another reason is because its too &ldquo;shady business&rdquo;. So Morgan took revenge by &ldquo;spreading rumors on Wall St that made investors&rdquo; (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">history.com/Nikola-Tesla)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cautious to give Westinghouse additional cash. Westinghouse was on the edge of bankruptcy so Tesla tore up his own contract, giving up his claim to all royalties, to Westinghouse in which would have made him a billionaire. Westinghouse was saved from financial ruin because Tesla tore up his one billion dollar contract. But. Tesla could no longer rely on Westinghouse for a paycheck.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around 1895 Teslas laboratory was burned down to a crisp, destroying years worth of notes and scientific equipment. Nikola Tesla had to relocate to </span><a href="http://www.history.com/topics/us-states/colorado"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Springs for the next two years. He then returned back to New York in 1900 &ldquo;Desperate for an investment to continue his work in building a global communications network centered called the Wardenclyffe Tower (located on Long Island). Tesla took a terrible deal with Edisons investor, Morgan. He gave up 51% ownership in all his existing and future patents and inventions relating to electric lighting and wireless telegraphy or telephony. In return, he only received $150,000 of the $1 million he needed&rdquo; (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">biography.com/Nikola-tesla-9504443).</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After taking a second small loan from Morgan, Tesla was forced to use his own funds just to keep his work going. &ldquo;To make matters even worse, his radio patents had been stripped away and given to an Italian inventor, Guglielmo Marconi, whose money and connections enabled him to override Teslas rightful claim to the patents. Marconi was later awarded a Nobel Prize for his achievements in radio, leaving Tesla out in the cold without the funds to sue for what was rightfully his&rdquo;(</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">pbs.org/tesla). &ldquo;Marconi is a good fellow. Let him continue. He is using seventeen of my patents&rdquo; (Nikola Tesla). </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this draw back, Morgan began to &ldquo;lose faith&rdquo; in Tesla and decided to cut back on his funding to Tesla because Teslas promise of making an electrical device in means of transferring information that were already &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; by Marconi. Even with this a downside for Nikola Tesla still did not give up. He did not give up when a majority of his patents rights were taken away, his name and inventions were smeared as ludacris all over town, being called a lunatic (because he claimed he received messages from space in which we do now aka satellites/radio waves) or a mad scientist trying to destroy the world (even though he tried to make the world a better place of gaining electricity the people were scared of him because he &ldquo;knows too much&rdquo; in which defies there logic). &nbsp;He kept working and he kept believing in himself and his ideas. A lot of good things came of out of his persistence and determination in the face of adversity. Nikola Tesla had received over 700 patents in his lifetime.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ldquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All that was great in the past was ridiculed, condemned, combated, and suppressed&mdash; only to emerge all the more powerfully, all the more triumphantly from the struggle &ldquo; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Nikola Tesla)</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As years pass by Nikola Tesla became a very old fragile man. He was left bankrupt and in debt, Tesla spent his last days in an apartment #3327 of a New York hotel, depressed and alone. Working on new patents as his energy and mental health began to fade away. Edison went on to become an American Hero and his company would soon form part of General Electric.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 7, 1943, the story of Nikola Tesla was ending. He looked out Manhattan skyline for the very last time and saw a sky lit up with twinkling lights and millions of lives transformed by his invention of ingenuity. &nbsp;The ability to generate and to transmit electricity and the invention of machines to use at will, have greatly changed our world in ways our ancestors could not have possibly imagined. Our ancestors thought the Earth was flat, thought we could not go to the moon, &nbsp;travel by air, or even &nbsp;go faster than sound barrier, etc. Thanks to new advancement of technology and daring explorers of the unknown that dare to challenge common belief systems, we proved them wrong in numerous ways. &nbsp;With that in mind we already now generate billions of watts every second, every hour, every day. Whenever we use coal, solar, hydro, gas, wind, thermo (still be tested to improve its efficiency such as volcanic energy source), and nuclear fission stations they all rely on the principles discovered by Michael Faraday, Nikola Tesla, Thomas Edison, and all the early free thinker electrical engineers. We now take electricity for granted and have forgotten how it once was an awe-inspiring and the enigmatic force it once was. Today the modern world would collapse all around us and our lives would be very, different without electricity. &ldquo;Later that year the U.S. Supreme Court voided four of Marconis key patents, belatedly acknowledging Teslas innovations in radio (and was nicknamed the &ldquo;father of the radio&rdquo;) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Nikola Tesla."&nbsp;History.com)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Even though Nikola Tesla was plague by OCD and an unknown illness in which cause hallucinations and with the suppression of cash flow to his inventions, he was still able to change the world by making AC possible. Without it we would not have advanced toward the twenty-first century.</span></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you Nikola Tesla for your contributions, even though you faced many hardships you were still able to change the world by persistence, determination, futuristic mind, and in hopes of helping humanity as a whole. With that I applaud you Nikola Tesla bravo, bravo.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'Nikola Tesla, english, project, OLD, October 2, 2014 , Thomas Edison, AC, DC, AC power, DC power, AC/DC, inventors, history, science, wireless', '', 'published', 0),
